# Vulnerability Reports

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ To rub salt in the wound, when a company closes the report as invalid, the bug bounty platform reduces your reputation points. This chapter should help you avoid that situation by giving you tips for writing a good bug report.

## READ THE POLICY

After submitting my report, I waited for the minimum bounty of $500. Within five minutes of submission, the program politely told me the vulnerability was already known and that researchers had been asked not to submit it.

> Learn from my mistakes; read the policies.

## INCLUDE DETAILS; THEN INCLUDE MORE

If you want the company to take your report seriously, provide details that include the following:

- The URL and any affected parameters needed to replicate the vulnerability
- Your browser, your operating system (if applicable), and the version of the tested app.
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- An explanation of impact, including how the bug could be exploited
- A recommended fix to remediate the vulnerability
- POC â‡’ Screenshot or Video

## RECONFIRM THE VULNERABILITY

Karlsson is among the best bug bounty hackers, but even he almost made an embarrassing mistake. Make sure you confirm your bugs before reporting them. It is a big letdown to think youâ€™ve found a significant bug only to realize youâ€™ve misunderstood the application and submitted an invalid report.

## YOUR REPUTATION

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Whenever you think of submitting a bug, step back and ask yourself whether you would be proud to publicly disclose the report.

</aside>

But on all bug bounty platforms, your statistics matter. Theyâ€™re tracked, and companies use them to determine whether to invite you to private programs.

## SHOW RESPECT FOR THE COMPANY

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Although itâ€™s easy to forget, not all companies have the resources to immediately respond to reports or integrate bug fixes.

Bacchus helped me understand the problems `triagers` experience while operating a bounty program:

- Although bug bounty programs are continually improving, they receive **many invalid reports**, particularly when theyâ€™re public programs. This is referred to as noise.
- Bounty programs have to find some way of balancing **bug remediation** with preexisting development obligations.
- **Validating reports** in complicated systems takes time. For this reason, writing clear descriptions and reproduction steps is important.
- Not all companies have the dedicated **security personnel** to run a full-time bounty program.
- Fixing bugs takes time, especially if the company goes through a full **development life cycle**. To integrate a fix, the company might need to go through certain steps, such as debugging, writing tests, and staging deployments.
- Bug bounty programs want hackers to return. Thatâ€™s because, as `HackerOne` has described, the severity of the bugs that a hacker reports typically increases as that hacker submits more bugs to a single program.
- **Bad press** is real. Programs always run the risk of mistakenly dismissing a vulnerability, taking too long on a fix, or awarding a bounty a hacker believes is too low.

## APPEALING BOUNTY REWARDS

If you disagree on a received amount, have a discussion why you believe it deserves a higher reward.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Thanks very much for the bounty. I really appreciate it. I was curious how the amount was determined. I was expecting $X, but you awarded $Y. I thought this bug could be used to [exploit Z], which could have a significant impact on your [system/users]. I was hoping you could help me understand so I can better focus my time on what matters most to you in the future.

</aside>

But I recommend you only reference reports from the same company. Donâ€™t reference larger
payouts from different companies because a bounty from company A doesnâ€™t necessarily justify the same bounty from company B.
